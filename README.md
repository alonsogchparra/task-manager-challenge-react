# Infocasas Challenge Frontend

The goal here is to set up a personal task management app that lets users track and focus on the things they need to get done.

The project here was built with react so to make it work correctly you have to install the dependencies like this

```
yarn install
```

And to run the project use this command
```
yarn start
```

Now in this project you can add the task you want it to be completed, once added you can click on it to mark it as completed (You can mark or unmark it everytime you want). Also have the chance to edit the task if you write something wrong or if you want to change it. Besides there is the option to delete the task.

On this project you can use the checkbox to filter the tasks that are completed or you can search an specific task. 

## How it works?

- Add the task
- If you completed it you can click on the task name and will mark it like this: **~~Do this challenge~~** (This way you can see the difference which tasks are done and which one are not)
- If you use the checkbox to filter only the completed tasks, you will see the task marked this way: **~~Do this challenge~~**
- You have another search bar to search the task you want to find (It doesn't matter if it's completed or not).
